#Intro

The following is a simple Spark Image build using apache/spark repo but adding libraries to interact with GCS and S3 as well as the open table format Iceberg. 

#Keys

The key files need to be created locally, the template is on the _template records, for Google it is a simple gcp auth file and for AWS it is simply concatinating access_key and secret. The AWS key is currently not being used and is there for possible future use-cases.
